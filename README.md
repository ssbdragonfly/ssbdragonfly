# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Shaurya! 
I am a high school student at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/), where I focus on taking classes at higher levels of computer science and mathematics. I do competitive math + programming, machine learning research, am a hackathon enthusiast (6/8 wins, talked to co-founder of Venmo and multiple VCs) and organize the largest high school hackathon on the east coast ([HackTJ](https://hacktj.org)), am a founder [@ CitySwipe](https://cityswipe.app), and am an avid cricket watcher and player. If you go to my school, the clubs you might catch me at are [Math Team](https://tjvmt.com), [Computer Team](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/ict/), and [Physics Team](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/physics/).
