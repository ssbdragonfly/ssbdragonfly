# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Shaurya! 
I am a high school student at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/), where I focus on taking classes at higher levels of computer science and mathematics. I do competitive math + programming, computational modeling/inference systems research, am a hackathon enthusiast (7/10 wins), dabble in startups (have acquired investment, talked to VCs, etc;), organize the largest high school hackathon in the world ([HackTJ](https://hacktj.org)), and love to watch and play cricket. The clubs you might catch me at in school are [Math Team](https://tjvmt.com), [Computer Team](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/ict/), and the [HackTJ Team](https://hacktj.org). Feel free to reach out at bisthshaurya314@gmail.com if you want to talk!
