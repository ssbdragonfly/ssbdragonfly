# Hi üëã I am Shaurya! 
I am a high school student at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/), where I focus on taking classes at higher levels of computer science and mathematics. I do competitive math + programming, machine learning research, organize the largest high school hackathon on the east coast ([HackTJ](https://hacktj.org)), and am an avid cricket watcher and player. If you go to my school, the clubs you might catch me at are [Math Team](https://tjvmt.com), [Computer Team](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/ict/), and [Physics Team](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/physics/).

### üì∫ Highlights
- Talking to the founder of Venmo because of [Jelly-Up](https://github.com/Team-S-I-R/jelly-up)
- Winning my first ever hackathon because of [X-pire Tray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFZMirE9xl8). It's a nostalgic project to look back upon, taught me a lot, and triggered me to go to more hackathons! Got airpods from this one!
- Getting a really nice [keychron keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MNBP7YP?smid=A19P1OE43Y3F5A&th=1) and some other stuff because of [Arcade @ Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/arcade/).
- Making [CitySwipe](https://cityswipe.app), winning first of 550 teams at a hackathon (with mostly college students), pitching to a VC, and speaking in front of 400 people about it.
